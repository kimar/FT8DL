About Cloudlog

This feature allows you to upload the QSO record to Cloudlog immediately after QSO is completed.

You need to obtain the API KEY in the API Key field of the cloudlog and enter it into the software.

The server address must start with http or https, for example, http://192.168.1.3:1234.

You can view the station ID in the "Station Locations" part of Cloudlog.
